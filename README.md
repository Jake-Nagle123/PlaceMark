# PlaceMark

## Overview
#### The objective of assignment was to create a point of interest and use that as the foundation to build upon were users would find interesting.

## Project Description
The chosen point of interest was soccer stadiums mainly in England were the sport thrives. The project was developed any soccer fan could visit a stadium on any given week and provide a rating for that stadium.

The user, once they have created an account has the option to organise their ratings on a weekly basis and give their opinions about their experience of a match by adding their ratings. This could be insightful information for tv platforms who get to pick games to show or the general soccer fan.

A visitor to the deployed site is first brought to a welcome page. They have the option of creating an account with basic information such as their name and email address. Once signed in the user visits another page where they can add their weekly trips.

A signed in user can see a about us page which is a mix of icons. Another option is the user can click on a linked icon to visit a different page where they add stadiums. The stadium details include the name, competition, rating, city, latitude and longitude.

Vigorous tests are created using a test driver development to create all the methods in the files. The user Api and other Api details are retrieved using Swagger.

The userâ€™s details were to be saved in a mongo database using Studio 3T and is on rendered online. However, I could not get the system to work as planned using mongo developed using Json instead.
